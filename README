This R package is a wrapper around the liblinear C/C++ machine learning library.

Install the latest version via git:
  git clone http://github.com/lynaghk/Rliblinear/
  R CMD build Rliblinear
  R CMD install Rliblinear

Ten-fold cross validation:
  source(Rliblinear)
  data(iris)
  liblinear(data = iris[,1:4],
            labels = iris[,5],
            cross = 10
            )


Liblinear
---------
Liblinear allows the estimation of predictive linear models:
  L1- or L2-regularized logistic regression
  L1- or L2-regularized L2-loss support vector classification
  L2-regularized L1-loss support vector classification
  multi-class support vector classification.
