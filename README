This R package is a wrapper around the liblinear C/C++ library for machine learning. 
It allows the estimation of predictive linear models such as L1- or L2-regularized 
logistic regression, L1- or L2-regularized L2-loss support vector classification, 
L2-regularized L1-loss support vector classification and multi-class support vector 
classification. The estimation of the models is particularly fast as compared to other 
libraries. For more information on liblinear itself, refer to:
