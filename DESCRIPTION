Description: This R package is a wrapper around the liblinear C/C++ library for large linear classification
             It estimates predictive linear models such as L1- or L2-regularized logistic regression, L1- or L2-regularized L2-loss support vector classification, L2-regularized L1-loss support vector classification and multi-class support vector classification.
             LIBLINEAR can handle problems with millions of instances and features.
             For more information on the C/C++ liblinear library itself, refer to R.-E. Fan, K.-W. Chang, C.-J. Hsieh, X.-R. Wang, and C.-J. Lin.
